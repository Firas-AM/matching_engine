# matching_engine
The code was developed using flask as a web framework and python.
to run the code, you need to install flask and run the server.
Please check that you are inside a virtual environment. 
Then inside the directory, run the following command:
```
pip install flask 
set FLASK_APP=app.py
set FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
The endpoints are:
POST /buy
POST /sell
GET /book 

all are fully functional. 
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. 
I would be happy to discuss the project.
